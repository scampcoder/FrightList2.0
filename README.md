# Fright List 2.0

## Introduction
- This is an updated version of my previous FrightList app - using React.
- The use of this app would be for the user to be able to search for horror films based on names and categories as well as keep a list of watched movies and to be watched movies.
- As a horror buff myself I find it annoying to have my movie list and reviews in two places and always have to search for more when looking for new movies to watch or deciding what to watch. I think an app that had it all in one place and could be used with friends sounds really fun and easier to deal with.
- You could use the app to sort out things you weren't currently interested in. For example, if you want a thriller with no gore or a creature-feature with no nudity, etc.
- This could potentially be used to help promote new horror films, horror watch parties, etc.

## Expected List of Features
- User login and data tracking per user
- Mobile app or at least a responsive web app for mobile use
- Search function with keywords as well as categories
- Review section and the ability to leave new reviews/comments
- User lists for watched and to be watched horror movies
- Perhaps have a “movie of the week”?

## What I Learned
- How to use Sass with React: install Sass and update filenames. React takes care of the rest!
